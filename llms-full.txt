## The Agentic CMO — The Book

### Overview
- Title: The Agentic CMO
- Subtitle: A playbook for the hybrid marketing team
- Author: Francesco Federico
- Date Published: June 2025
- Pages: 494
- Format: eBook (Kindle)
- ASIN: B0FDXCZSS3
- Publisher: Self-published
- Language: English
- Genre: Business & Management
- Amazon URL: https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0FDXCZSS3
- Cover Image: https://francescofederico.com/img/book-cover.png

### The Premise
The age of marketing automation is ending. The era of marketing autonomy has begun. Agentic AI—systems that perceive, decide, act, and learn independently—represents the single largest opportunity in marketing and sales. McKinsey estimates the broader economic impact at $13 trillion. Yet only 1% of organisations have reached implementation maturity. The gap between understanding AI and deploying it at scale is where most companies stall. This book is the bridge. Not theory. Not commentary. A working framework for CMOs building hybrid human-AI organisations.

### Three Core Principles
1. **Hybrid Intelligence, Not Replacement** — Organisations where humans and AI amplify each other outperform those that treat AI as a substitution play.
2. **Organisational Design Over Tool Selection** — Tools evolve faster than any book can document. Team structures, governance models, and role definitions endure.
3. **Scale, Not Pilots** — Most organisations are stuck in pilot purgatory. The book maps the path from experimentation to enterprise-wide transformation, drawing on BCG's S-curve model.

### Frameworks Page
- URL: https://francescofederico.com/frameworks.html
- Description: Dedicated page with in-depth explanations of all six strategic frameworks from The Agentic CMO. Covers the PACE Model (Perception, Action, Reasoning, Learning), the Agentic CMO Competency Model (12 competencies across AI Literacy, Change Leadership, Ethical Governance, Technical Fluency), the Value Stack (Efficiency → Enhancement → Strategic Value), Three Architectural Models (Hub-and-Spoke, Embedded, Hybrid Collaborative), the 90-Day Agentic Transformation Plan (Assessment → Pilot → Scale), and the BCG S-Curve Model Application for moving from pilot purgatory to enterprise-scale AI value creation.
