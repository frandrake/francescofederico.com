At Adobe Summit 2025, the company made one thing clear: generative AI is moving to the next stage. Adobe is embracing agentic AI to power several marketing workflows.

In the most significant product evolution since the launch of Adobe Experience Platform (AEP), Adobe unveiled two AI-powered pillars for marketing and customer experience:

- **Adobe Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator**
- **Adobe Brand Concierge**

These tools are designed as digital workers who understand your business context, operate within brand guardrails, and collaborate with each other to deliver outcomes — at scale.

## The Agent Orchestrator: AI's Command Centre

The Agent Orchestrator acts as the AI "command centre" for Adobe's Experience Cloud, coordinating a fleet of intelligent agents that carry out key tasks in marketing, sales, data and content management.

Adobe has launched ten pre-built agents, each purpose-built for high-impact use cases:

- **Audience Agent:** Builds and refines audience segments using real-time engagement data.
- **Content Production Agent:** Generates and assembles copy and visual assets, all on-brand.
- **Journey Agent:** Orchestrates personalised, cross-channel customer journeys.
- **Data Engineering Agent:** Handles the fastidious work of data integration and quality.

These agents don't operate in silos. The Orchestrator ensures they work in tandem. For example, a customer journey designed by one agent might automatically trigger the creation of campaign assets by another.

> Built natively into AEP, the Orchestrator has access to unified customer profiles, Adobe's Experience Data Model (XDM), and enterprise-grade data governance — so the agents act with context and compliance from day one.

If this works as promised, marketers will no longer need to hop between tools. With orchestrated agents, they can design, launch, test, and optimise experiences with speed and scale.

## Brand Concierge: Redefining Customer Interaction

The Orchestrator powers internal workflows, but the real news — to me — is Brand Concierge. It redefines how customers interact with a brand.

Brand Concierge is an AI-powered digital assistant designed to weave a company's tone, knowledge, and customer context into every conversation. From shoppers searching for a product to a B2B buyer exploring complex offerings, the Brand Concierge provides:

- Natural, multimodal dialogue (text, voice, image-based)
- Personalised recommendations based on real-time data
- Answers rooted in brand-approved content and logic

Like the Agent Orchestrator, Brand Concierge can coordinate with other agents. It might pull segment insights from the Audience Agent or initiate content creation through the Production Agent.

This tight integration makes for truly seamless and intelligent customer interactions.

## Why This Matters: The Three C's

Bringing agentic AI into marketing workflows gives us a first glimpse of what an agentic workforce can bring to the table — but only when three conditions are met:

**Coordination.** The Orchestrator prevents AI sprawl by ensuring agents work in harmony.

**Context.** Deep access to real-time customer data makes agents grounded and relevant.

**Control.** Brand safety and governance are built in from the ground up.

In practice, these agentic capabilities unlock new efficiency for marketers and richer experiences for customers. And with Adobe's strategic partnerships (with Microsoft, SAP, and IBM), businesses can bring agentic AI into complex enterprise environments without starting from scratch.

## What CMOs Need To Do To Prepare

CMOs and transformation leaders should be asking:

- Where are our biggest process bottlenecks in marketing and CX?
- What tasks could be delegated to agents without sacrificing quality?
- How might agent orchestration help us scale personalisation responsibly?

It is clear that CMOs and their leaders will, in the very near future, not only lead people but also teams made of useful agentic AI tools that complement and empower their talent.

In this context, upskilling and training becomes vital to ensure a smooth and safe transition to this new paradigm.

> The question is no longer whether AI agents will become part of your marketing organisation. It's whether you'll design the collaboration intentionally — or have it imposed on you by competitors who moved first.
