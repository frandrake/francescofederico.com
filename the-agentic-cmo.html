Unlike traditional marketing automation, agentic AI systems act as digital colleagues capable of making millions of autonomous decisions daily, as demonstrated by platforms like Starbucks' Deep Brew."

            <h2>The Premise</h2>
            <p class="premise-lead">The age of marketing automation is ending. The era of marketing autonomy has begun.</p>
            <p>Agentic AI—systems that perceive, decide, act, and learn independently—represents the single largest opportunity in marketing and sales. McKinsey estimates the broader economic impact at $13 trillion. Yet only 1% of organisations have reached implementation maturity. The gap between understanding AI and deploying it at scale is where most companies stall.</p>
            <p>This book is the bridge. Not theory. Not commentary. A working framework for CMOs building hybrid human-AI organisations.</p>

            <div class="divider"></div>

            <h3>Three Principles</h3>
            <ul class="framework-list">
              <li><strong>Hybrid Intelligence, Not Replacement</strong> — Organisations where humans and AI amplify each other outperform those that treat AI as a substitution play. The book addresses how to design for this.</li>
              <li><strong>Organisational Design Over Tool Selection</strong> — Tools evolve faster than any book can document. Team structures, governance models, and role definitions endure. Start there.</li>
              <li><strong>Scale, Not Pilots</strong> — Most organisations are stuck in pilot purgatory. The book maps the path from experimentation to enterprise-wide transformation, drawing on BCG's S-curve model.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="divider"></div>

            <h3>Key Frameworks</h3>
            <ul class="framework-list">
              <li><strong>The PACE Model</strong> — Perception, Action, Reasoning, Learning: a framework for assessing agentic AI capabilities and maturity.</li>
              <li><strong>The Agentic CMO Competency Model</strong> — 12 competencies across four domains: AI Literacy, Change Leadership, Ethical Governance, and Technical Fluency.</li>
              <li><strong>The Value Stack</strong> — From Efficiency to Enhancement to Strategic value creation through agentic AI.</li>
              <li><strong>Three Architectural Models</strong> — Hub-and-Spoke, Embedded, and Hybrid Collaborative models for structuring human-AI collaboration.</li>
              <li><strong>The 90-Day Agentic Transformation Plan</strong> — A ready-to-implement playbook for marketing leaders.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="divider"></div>
